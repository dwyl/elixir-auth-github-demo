# `elixir-auth-github` demo

A tutorial showing you how to create a Phoenix app
with GitHub Authentication
using [elixir-auth-github](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github)
in 5 minutes<sup>1</sup>



## _Deployment_?

This guide is meant to get your Phoenix App up-and-running
with [elixir-auth-github](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-github)
on **`localhost`.
The demo is deployed to Heroku to demonstrate that the code works as expected.
If you want to deploy your App to Heroku,
we created a _separate_ guide for that!
